# jGREP
The well known unix grep command, but the java version !

This program is just a simple grep-like program implemented using Java. It is not meant to replace grep itself. 
Think of it more like a simple "CTRL+F" program, but for the terminal. You can specify a pattern and a text or file,
and if the pattern is found, the output text will highlight the pattern in the text/file.
